##Describing the coding process

My coding process have primarily been exploratory and a bit messy. The final product is a result of me trying out different stuff, fiddling around with elements of code that I thought were exciting on the go. I would find something in tutorials on YouTube and on websites, as well as the p5.js reference page itself, and the try it out myself. As with every coding process, there have been a lot of testing were I would write a line of code, then test if it works, write some more, test some more and so on.  

##What constitutes a program?

In a computer tecnical prospective, a program is made of code. This code determine what the program is capable of and what the purpose is. As a result of this a program can be almost everything.


##What is "error"?

Error is when something goes wrong or are about to. When something is suppose to work but for some reason doesn't. Erroors can be divided into at least two subcategories: humnan errors and technical errors. The human errors are when humans fail to interact with the given object. This can be due to many different things: lack of knowledge, lack of understanding etc. Technical error are when the technique fails to work as it is ment to do. This can be caused by the software the hardware but also human misuse.
