EDIT: I'm having some trouble with my miniEX5. I have multiple different problems loading different external files in my exercise. I have been trying to troubleshoot errors for 3-4 hours now, with no luck. I will continue to troubleshoot for the rest of the evening, however, my final version of the exercise will probably be delayed by this. I will do my very best to get it online as soon as possible, and definitely before tomorrow evening.

#Blam!

For this project i've used a range of different functions from the RiTa library, however, i've encountered a bunch of errors which have caused a major delay in my programming process.
So far my experience working with found text and extern source materials have been really frustrating due to all the errors i have encountered. My final sketch is therefore not accesible at the moment. I will fix this as soon as i can.
