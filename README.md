# Mini-Exercises

EDIT: I'm having some trouble with my miniEX5. I have multiple different problems loading different external files in my exercise. I have been trying to troubleshoot errors for 3-4 hours now, with no luck. I will continue to troubleshoot for the rest of the evening, however, my final version of the exercise will probably be delayed by this. I will do my very best to get it online as soon as possible, and definitely before tomorrow evening.
