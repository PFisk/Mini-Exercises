# Dronestre.am

## Why this API?

This work is a collaboration between Philip and Sylvester. We have utilized the dronestre.am api data. This data contains every instance of a drone attack conducted by the United States government on foreign soil since 2002. 

The data is still updated reguarly, however because of the rarity of the attacks relative to the window we are looking at the program, we have chosen to illustrate the attacks in ”live” mode, meaning every instance is run through the program. The data represented is the total death toll per attack (the bigger the icon, the more deaths per attack). We discussed several parameters to show, including child deaths and injuries, but settled for the latter. We chose this dataset because it is interesting and important to illustrate that these things happen in our world. The developer behind the data api, has also created a twitter bot, which tweets everytime a new attack occurs. 

## Working with API

Acquiring, using and representing the data was for us a frustrating task. Seemingly simple and easy to use data, often seemed to not corporate with us in the browser (dronestream was actually our second choice of data set, because the previous one refused to recognize a ”:”). Using the data functions in the syntax also proved challenging and in times counterlogic, and required a bit of workaround. There are a lot of opportunities when utilizinf api data once you get it to work. 

## Reflection on the aesthetics of big data

Big data has a ton of functions and qualities to it. We had a critic perspective in mind when developing our program and continously discussed how to illustrate the data (ranging from ”thumbs up”, dollar signs etc.), to comment on the political happenings of the world. As mentioned, illustrating these datasets, which often are out of sight in everyday media, is important for the understanding of the world around us.
